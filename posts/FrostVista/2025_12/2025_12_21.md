summary: Clarifying IP vs IE interrupt concepts in RISC-V, hardware configuration issues, and trap entry point implementation lessons.
---


{
Today, I encountered an issue where IP and IE were confused. I thought that IP settings would only take effect after configuring IE, but this assumption was incorrect. IP and IE don't have much overlap; IP settings don't depend on IE. IP is solely responsible for notifying the core that an event has occurred, while IE determines whether the core should handle it.

If IP is 1 but no interrupt occurs, it means you haven't enabled the interrupt (IE). If IP remains 0, it indicates the hardware is not configured correctly.

I always forget to save the scene when writing trap entry points--this is a lesson learned.
